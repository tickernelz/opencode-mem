## What is OpenCode Memory?

OpenCode Memory is a plugin that provides AI coding agents with persistent memory across sessions. It uses vector embeddings and SQLite to store and retrieve contextual information efficiently.

### Key Capabilities

- **Dual Scopes**: Separate user-level and project-level memory contexts
- **Vector Search**: Fast similarity-based retrieval
- **Web Interface**: Full-featured UI for memory management
- **Auto-Capture**: Intelligent background memory extraction
- **Local-First**: All data stored on your machine
- **Zero Config**: Works out of the box with sensible defaults

## System Requirements

- Bun runtime (recommended) or Node.js 18+
- OpenCode AI platform
- 2GB RAM minimum (4GB recommended)
- 1GB disk space for database
